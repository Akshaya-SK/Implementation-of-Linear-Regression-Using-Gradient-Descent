# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the profit of a city using the linear regression model with gradient descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the required libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Load the dataset (50_startups.csv) using pandas.
2. Extract independent variables (e.g., R&D Spend) and the dependent variable (Profit). Normalize the data for faster convergence.
3. Set initial values for the slope (m) and intercept (b). Choose a learning rate and number of iterations.
4. For each iteration, Predict output using the current values of m and b, Calculate gradients of the loss function (MSE), Update m and b using gradients and learning rate.
5. Display the final regression equation. Plot the dataset and regression line.
